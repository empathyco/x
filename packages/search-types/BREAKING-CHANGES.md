# BREAKING CHANGES

## 9.0.0

> EX-3917 Change `HierarchicalFilter` `children` prop to be optional.

## 8.0.0

> EX-3347 Remove `MultiSelect` model.
> 
> EX-3300 Transform `Sort` model into a string.
> 
> EX-3300 Remove `SortDirection` enum.

## 7.0.0

> EX-3222 Add `EditableNumberRangeFilter` model to represent range filters that the user can mutate its value.
>
> EX-3222 Add `BooleanFilter` model to share the properties of filters that the user can select or deselect. `SimpleFilter`, `HierarchicalFilter` and `NumberRangeFilter` now extend from `BooleanFilter`.
>
> EX-3222 `selected`, `totalResults` and `value` properties have been moved to `BooleanFilter` from `Filter`. It's necessary to replace `Filter` type references with `BooleanFilter`. Filters and facets schemas have been replaced accordingly.

## 6.0.0

>
> EX-2320 Split the facet model into `Facet`, `SimpleFacet`, `HierarchicalFacet` and `RangeFacet`.
