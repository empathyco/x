The Related Tags UI component helps your shoppers to refine a specific search query and find what
they’re looking for with just one click. They only appear after the search process is completed, and
the results appear to fine-tune the search with extra information and get highly relevant results.
They are shown as labels usually at the top of the search engine results page (SERP), but Empathy
Platform Interface X supports displaying them anywhere on the SERP instead.

[Related Tags](/understand-empathy-platform/search-features/related-tags-overview.md).

:::

Related Tags can be **organic**, using information on the terms most used by shoppers to refine a
query. Otherwise, you can create manually **curated** related tags, based on your business needs, by
using the Related Tags management tool in the Empathy Platform Playboard.

::: warning

Related Tags are generated organically using collective shopper behavior to identify associated
terms used to refine a search query. For a correct performance, make sure that your current search
service supports this type of feature.

<!-- You can configure the behavior of Related Tags and decide whether they’re selectable or not. If Related Tags aren’t selectable, they modify the initial query syntax by adding the related-search keywords to the query term initially typed in the search bar. Otherwise, the initial query syntax will still remain so that shoppers can select or deselect Related Tags at their ease, exploring different options and combinations. -->

## Tailor the web experience

- Configure the position and place it wherever you prefer, although Related Tags usually appear
  below the search bar after completing the search.
- Show as many Related Tags as you want.
- Animate the display of Related Tags at your ease.
- Customize content. Show whatever you need: text, images, icons.
- Display curated related tags differently to organic related tags for shoppers to clearly identify
  which of them have been willfully created as a sign of transparency.

<!-- - Choose if Related Tags are selectable or change the syntax of the initial query in the search box. -->
