The Related Tags UI component helps your shoppers to refine a specific search query and find what
they’re looking for with just one click. They only appear after the search process is completed, and
the results appear to fine-tune the search with extra information and get highly relevant results.
They are shown as labels usually at the top of the results page, but can be displayed anywhere
instead.

::: warning

Related Tags are generated using collective shopper behavior to identify associated terms used to
refine a search query. For a correct performance, make sure that your current search service
supports this type of feature.

<!-- You can configure the behavior of Related Tags and decide whether they’re selectable or not. If Related Tags aren’t selectable, they modify the initial query syntax by adding the related-search keywords to the query term initially typed in the search bar. Otherwise, the initial query syntax will still remain so that shoppers can select or deselect Related Tags at their ease, exploring different options and combinations. -->

## Tailor the web experience

- Configure the position and place it wherever you prefer, although Related Tags usually appear
  below the search bar after completing the search.
- Show as many Related Tags as you want.
- Animate the display of Related Tags at your ease.
- Customize content. Show whatever you need: text, images, icons.
<!-- - Choose if Related Tags are selectable or change the syntax of the initial query in the search box. -->
