The Identifier Results UI component presents a type of search results intended for product reference
codes. When shoppers start typing, a reference code query type is detected, and a list displays
instantly with query-matching product results. When shoppers select an identifier result hint from
the list, they go directly to the product detail page (PDP).

ID Results are generated using a Search service that searches the product catalogue by ID. For a
correct performance, make sure that your current search service supports this type of feature.
