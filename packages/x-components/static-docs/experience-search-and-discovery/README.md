title: Experience search & discovery
---

Search inevitably is key when people look for specific products in an online store. It's the door
to the entire product catalogue, so having an outstanding, well-structured, and optimized search UI
is a must.

However, it’s not enough. With the advanced features provided by some well-known search engines,
shoppers need a new dimension to **connect effortlessly** to the most relevant products, enjoy a
**smooth user experience**, and take advantage of **outstanding search and discovery capabilities**.

## Interface X and Interface X for Apps, the solution

Interface&nbsp;X and Interface&nbsp;X for Apps are a collection of libraries that lets you create a
smooth, personalized search and discovery experience, while significantly minimizing development
time. Interface&nbsp;X, and its version for native apps, will renew your search experience interface
layer, rendering the magic of search and delighting your shoppers with all experiences in one:
**user**, **search**, **navigation**, and **product discovery**.

There are many things to think about when designing a UI for search and discovery to provide a
consistent user experience and look-and-feel: every little design element, the layout structure,
animation, component, configuration, and behavior count. Interface&nbsp;X and Interface&nbsp;X for
Apps cover everything and even go beyond, thanks to their standalone, configurable building blocks
that allow you to quickly construct the search UI for your store:
**Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Components** and **Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Components for Apps**.

### Mix and match your experience

Each Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Component represents a graphical part of the UI, with
its own unique view and behavior. They’ve been smartly designed to **work together yet
independently**, so a single component adds real value to your UI by itself. The more components you
add and combine, the more functionality you get.

You can craft your own **UI bundle with the right components for your store**. There are numerous
X&nbsp;Components to choose from, and the catalogue evolves quickly with new experiences.

To help you discover the components and leverage the UI design process, most of the
X&nbsp;Components are distributed into **modules** which are intended for different purposes:
functional experience, interface design and behavior, web and design standardization… Just pick and
choose the modules and components that best suit your needs.
