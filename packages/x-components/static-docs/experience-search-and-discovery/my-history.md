From the frontend perspective, My History is a UI component that specifically manages the display of a list of history search suggestions. To display a dashboard featuring shoppers' data privacy and control, My History is combined with other UI elements and components, such as a toggle switch for shoppers to enable or disable search history.

::: note Search data storage

To show the complete list of history queries, My History component uses the history records saved on the shopper’s browser local history. See [Interface X data privacy and browser local storage](/explore-empathy-platform/experience-search-and-discovery/web-local-storage.md) to check out the information stored locally on the shopper’s device.
