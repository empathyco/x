From the frontend perspective, My History is a UI component that specifically manages the display of
a list of history search suggestions. To display a dashboard featuring shoppers' data privacy and
control, My History is combined with other UI elements and components, such as a toggle switch for
shoppers to enable or disable search history.

::: note Search data storage

To show the complete list of history queries, My History component uses the history records saved on
the shopper’s browser local history. See
[Interface X data privacy and browser local storage](/onboard-empathy-platform/experience-search-and-discovery/web-local-storage.md)
to check out the information stored locally on the shopper’s device.

- Layout the list of history queries as you want.
- Customize date and time format.
- Animate the display of My History dashboard at your ease.
- Customize content. Show whatever you need: text, images, icons...

::: note

Configuration options here only apply to tailor the My History component, which provides a way to
display the full list of history queries. Other UI elements that comprise the My History feature can
be configured as well. Check a complete list of UI components in the
[Interface X Components UI Reference](/develop-empathy-platform/ui-reference/).
