# History Queries UI

The History Queries UI component displays the search history, allowing shopper to revisit the type
of products they’ve viewed before in a few clicks.

## Tailor the web experience

- Configure the position and place it wherever you prefer. Combine it with the
  [Empathize](empathize.md) container to display suggestions under the search bar on shopper
  interaction.
- Show as many history suggestions as you want.
- Choose the number of search records to store in the browser’s local storage to refresh the history
  list.
- Animate the display of History Queries at your ease.
- Customize content. Show whatever you need: text, images, icons.
- Display History Queries only from successful searches. No result, no search record stored. (Search
  X module required.)
- Configure clear buttons at your convenience. Let shoppers clear previous searches one-by-one,
  all-at-once, or either way.
- Display only the refined queries to match shopper intent. For example, if “dress” is the initial
  search, and it’s narrowed down using “long dress”, the history queries list only displays “long
  dress” since it represents the shopper’s real intention.

## Extend the performance

You can extend search history performance by combining it with the [Next Queries](next-queries.md)
component. All suggestions for shoppers about what to look next can be filtered against the
shopper’s search history so that only those suggestions that haven’t been used before in that
session will display.

[//]: # 'Link only when available to Search module page in UI reference'

Combine History Queries with the Search X module to ease shoppers' frustrations. That way, you can
configure it to display only successful history searches.
