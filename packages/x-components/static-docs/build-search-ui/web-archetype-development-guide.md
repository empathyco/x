In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to build a search and discovery layer based on predefined
features and components in a matter of minutes using the Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Archetype.

For this tutorial, the Empathy Search API is used, but you can use any search API. This guide
requires knowledge of JavaScript and Vue.js.

::: note Before you begin

To use Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Archetype as a search UI layer, you need:

- **Empathy Platform Search API** (or any search API that you use to retrieve search data).
- **Empathy Platform Search Adapter** to communicate with the Empathy Platform Search API (or the
  Empathy Search Adapter to connect with the search API you are using).

:::

##### Steps to build a search layer using the X Archetype project:

1. **Clone** the X&nbsp;Archetype project and **initialize** your repository.
2. Install the **project dependencies** and run the project development server.
3. Configure the **search adapter**.
4. Configure the **xPlugin**.

## Cloning the project and initializing your repository

Clone the [X Archetype project](https://github.com/empathyco/x-archetype.git) from the GitHub
repository to your target folder. You need a non-initialized repository, so make sure you remove the
git folder from the cloned project.

```batch
// Clone the X Archetype project from GitHub
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/empathyco/x-archetype.git <your-target-folder>

// Remove the git folder
rm -rf .git
```

::: develop

You can use [Degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to clone the git repository without
downloading the entire git history:
`npx degit https://github.com/empathyco/x-archetype.git <your-target-folder>`.

:::

Once you have cloned the project and removed the git history from the project, initialize the
repository from the root directory.

```batch
// Initialize the repository
git init
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial X-Components Setup"
git push -u origin main
```

Then, replace the current repository name (`@empathyco/x-archetype`) with the name of your
repository in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "<your-repo>",
  "author": "Empathy Systems Corporation S.L."
}
```

## Installing the dependencies and executing the project

Install the project dependencies via `npm` in the root folder of your cloned repository. Then, you
can run the project.

```batch
// Install the dependencies via npm
npm install

// Execute the project
npm run serve
```

For a full list of the project dependencies, check the
[`package.json`](https://github.com/empathyco/x-archetype/blob/main/package.json) file in the
Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Archetype repository.

## Configuring the search adapter

Before using your project, configure the Empathy Platform Search Adapter in the
`x-archetype/src/adapter/adapter.ts` file. The Empathy Platform Search Adapter contains a sample
configuration for setup, global configurations, or mappers that points to a demo environment. You
need to adjust the configuration according to the search features you use in your project.

Export the required search adapter with your configuration as you will need it for the search
[xPlugin configuration](#configuring-the-plugin).

::: interact

For detailed information about other configuration options in the Empathy Platform Search Adapter,
go to the
[x-adapter-platform repository](https://github.com/empathyco/x/tree/main/packages/x-adapter-platform).

:::

::: note

Although you configure the values for the `instance`, `language`, `scope`, and `endpoint` options
when integrating the project, you can still change these values when the project is deployed. Use
the `/x-archetype/public/snippet-script.js` file to initialize values for `lang`, `store`, `device`,
and `catalog` parameters.

For example, you may configure the adapter to use EN as `lang` so that when you search, the results
are displayed in English. However, if you want to deploy the application in Spain, you want the
`lang` to be ES. You change these values in the `snippet-script.js` file.

For detailed information, see
[Snippet configuration](web-archetype-integration-guide.md#snippet-configuration).

:::

## Configuring the plugin

The `xPlugin` initializes the properties needed by the X&nbsp;Components. It has key options that
you can configure in the `/x-archetype/src/x-components/plugin.options.ts` file.

Since the X&nbsp;Archetype project operates as a layer and is designed to be integrated on top of
any kind of website regardless the chosen technology, the `XInstaller` utility and its
`installXOptions` object are designed to install the xPlugin, adding the connection between the
X&nbsp;Components and the search API and bootstrapping the entire application with powerful APIs
that are available in the `window.InterfaceX` object.

To configure the xPlugin, run this code:

```typescript
import { InstallXOptions, XInstaller } from '@empathyco/x-components';
import App from './App.vue';
import store from './store';
import { adapter } from '../adapter';

export const installXOptions: InstallXOptions = {
  adapter,
  store,
  app: App
};

new XInstaller(installXOptions).init({
  instance: '<your-search-api-instance>',
  lang: '<your-application-language>',
  scope: '<your-application-scope>'
});
```

::: develop Next steps

Once you have your Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Archetype project, you're ready to **integrate** it in your
store or **extend** the search and discovery experience to meet your business needs:

- [**Integrate an Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Archetype project**](web-archetype-integration-guide.md)
  into an existing website.
- Change the **configuration of [X&nbsp;Components](web-how-to-use-x-components-guide.md)** or
  create new ones.
- Adapt the
  **[design system](https://github.com/empathyco/x/blob/main/packages/x-components/contributing/design-system.md)**
  to your branding.
- Manage
  **[internationalization options](https://github.com/empathyco/x-archetype/blob/main/docs/i18n.md)**
  to support different languages.
