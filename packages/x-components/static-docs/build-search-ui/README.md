## The Interface X ecosystem

The Interface&nbsp;X ecosystem consists of libraries of components for web. These independent
building blocks, with their own unique view and behavior, allows you to progressively build your
search and discovery experience. The more you add, the more functionality you get. There are
numerous components to choose from, and the catalog evolves quickly with new experiences.

Check out the **[open source project in GitHub](https://github.com/empathyco/x)**.

**[architecture](x-architecture/README.md)**.

## Integrate Interface X Archetype

Once you have finished developing or extending your search interface using the
Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Archetype project you will probably want to integrate it into your current
store. The integration of an existing Archetype into your project is pretty straightforward. You
will need to load the generated Javascript into your website and initialise it.

To start integrating an existent Archetype into your project please visit
[extended guide about Archetype integration](web-archetype-integration-guide.md).

## Develop with Interface X

You can use the Interface X in a project in two ways:

- using the separate **Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Archetype** project, an out-of-the-box project with all
  you need to get up and running fast, or
- integrating the individual **Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Components** library in your Vue project for a
  more custom approach.

::: note

You can use Empathy Search API, Elasticsearch, or Solr endpoints with both approaches.

##### Develop via Interface X Archetype

The **[Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Archetype](https://github.com/empathyco/x-archetype)** project is the
perfect combination of all the existing X&nbsp;Components. Instead of starting from a completely
blank canvas, ramp up quickly with an already working search and discovery experience. This is the
perfect solution for most cases. But don’t worry! It’s still super flexible! You’re still able to:

- Change the default styles for styles that match your application through design tokens or custom
  CSS.
- Change configuration parameters such as the number of suggestions, enable, or disable instant
  search.
- Change the layout, position, or the number of the components used.
- Use the individual X&nbsp;Component internationalization tool or use your own tool.
- Create new components or modify the existing ones.

To start developing the X&nbsp;Archetype project, see
**[Develop via Interface X Archetype](web-archetype-development-guide.md)**.

##### Develop via Interface X Components library

This is the more deep and flexible use of the
**[Interface X Components library](https://github.com/empathyco/x/tree/main/packages/x-components)**,
allowing you to import any components you desire into your Vue application. It lets you connect,
customize, extend, style, or even create new components without any limitations. This is the way to
go if you like to look under the hood!

- Mix and match with other Vue components.
- Implement in Vue or React projects.
- Extend component behavior with your own development.
- Determine styles using design tokens or custom CSS.

To get started with the X Components library, check out
**[Develop using Interface X Components library](web-x-components-integration-guide.md)**.

## How to use and configure the Interface X Components

Using the Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Components is a piece of cake! Just import and register the
component, include it in your template, and you’re ready to go! What’s more, each component offers
multiple configuration parameters to play around with, allowing you greater flexibility over the
experience.

Unsure how to start? Check out
**[How to use & configure Interface X Components in your project](web-how-to-use-x-components-guide.md)**.
