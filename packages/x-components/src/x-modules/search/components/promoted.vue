## Events

This component doesn't emit events.

## See it in action

In this example promoted data is passed as a prop.

_Here you can see how the `Promoted` component is rendered._

```vue
<template>
  <Promoted :promoted="promoted" />
</template>

<script>
  import { Promoted } from '@empathyco/x-components/search';

  export default {
    name: 'PromotedDemo',
    components: {
      Promoted
    },
    data() {
      return {
        promoted: {
          modelName: 'Promoted',
          id: 'promoted-example',
          url: 'https://my-website.com/summer-shirts',
          image: 'https://my-website.com/images/summer-shirts.jpg',
          title: 'Trendy summer shirts',
          position: 1
        }
      };
    }
  };
</script>
```

### Customizing the items with classes

The `titleClass` prop can be used to add classes to the promoted title.

```vue
<template>
  <Promoted :promoted="promoted" titleClass="x-bg-neutral-50" />
</template>

<script>
  import { Promoted } from '@empathyco/x-components/search';

  export default {
    name: 'PromotedDemo',
    components: {
      Promoted
    },
    data() {
      return {
        promoted: {
          modelName: 'Promoted',
          id: 'promoted-example',
          url: 'https://my-website.com/summer-shirts',
          image: 'https://my-website.com/images/summer-shirts.jpg',
          title: 'Trendy summer shirts',
          position: 1
        }
      };
    }
  };
</script>
```
