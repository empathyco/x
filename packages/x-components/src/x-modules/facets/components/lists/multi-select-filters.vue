# Examples

The component renders a list of filters, exposing a default slot to set how the filter should
be rendered. This component will change the facet configuration of the rendered filters to allow
multi selection. If you just need to render a list of filters that don't support multi-selection,
or are from a different facet, use the `Filters` component instead.

## Important

The component has two ways of receive the filters list, it can be injected by another component or
be send it as a prop. If the component doesnt have a parent component that receive and exposed a
filters list to their children, it is mandatory to send it as prop.

## Basic usage

Just provide the `filters` prop and the component that they should render. These filters *must* all
be from the same facet.

```vue
<MultiSelectFilters :filters="multi" v-slot="{ filter }">
  <button @click="doThings">{{ filter.label }}</button>
</MultiSelectFilters>
```

## Full example

The `MultiSelectFilters` component is prepared to be used with the `Facets` one and with the base
filter components (like the `SimpleFilter`). Apart from the filters array that is the only
mandatory prop, it allows you to configure the transitions (using the `animation` prop).

```vue
<template>
  <Facets v-slot="{ facet }">
    <MultiSelectFilters
      :animation="animation"
      :filters="facet.filters"
      v-slot="{ filter }">
      <SimpleFilter :filter="filter"/>
    </MultiSelectFilters>
  </Facets>
</template>

<script>
  import { StaggeredFadeAndSlide } from '@empathyco/x-components';
  import { Facets, MultiSelectFilters, SimpleFilter } from '@empathyco/x-components/facets';

  export default {
    components: {
      Facets,
      MultiSelectFilters,
      SimpleFilter
    },
    data() {
      return {
        animation: StaggeredFadeAndSlide
      };
    }
  }
</script>
```

> **Using injection**: It can receive the filters list by injection. It only works if it has a
> parent component that receives and exposes the filters list. Using the injection, It is not
> necessary to send the prop to the child components, it has to be send it in the parent component,
> the rest of components will inject this list.

```vue
<template>
  <Facets v-slot="{ facet }">
    <FiltersSearch :filters="facet.filters">
      <MultiSelectFilters
        :animation="animation"
        v-slot="{ filter }">
        <SimpleFilter :filter="filter"/>
      </MultiSelectFilters>
    </FiltersSearch>
  </Facets>
</template>
```

## Events

A list of events that the component will emit:

- `FacetMultiSelectChanged`: emitted to sync the multiselect configuration of the facet
that the filters belong to. The payload is the `facetId` that should change its configuration
to support multi selection.
