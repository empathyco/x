## Examples

### Default Usage

You don't need to pass any props, or slots. Simply add the component, and when it has any popular
searches it will show them.

```vue
<PopularSearches />
```

The component has two optional props. `animation` to render the component with an animation and
`maxItemToRender` to limit the number of popular searches will be rendered (by default it is 5).

```vue
<PopularSearches :animation="FadeAndSlide" :maxItemsToRender="10" />
```

### Overriding Popular Search's Content

You can use your custom implementation of the Popular Search's content. In the example below,
instead of using the default Popular Search's content, an icon is added, as well as a span with the
query of the Popular Search's suggestion.

```vue
<PopularSearches>
  <template #suggestion-content="{ suggestion }">
    <img class="x-popular-search__icon" src="./popular-search-icon.svg" />
    <span class="x-popular-search__query">{{ suggestion.query }}</span>
  </template>
</PopularSearches>
```

### Adding a Custom Popular Search Item

You can use your custom implementation for the whole Popular Search item. In the example below, we
change the default implementation of the Popular Search in Popular Searches. A custom Popular Search
implementation is added, it has an image and a span as content (as in the previous example). Also, a
button with a user customized behaviour is added at the same hierarchical level as the Popular
Search component.

```vue
<PopularSearches>
  <template #suggestion="{suggestion}">
    <PopularSearch :suggestion="suggestion">
      <template #default="{suggestion}">
        <img class="x-popular-search__icon" src="./popular-search-icon.svg" />
        <span class="x-popular-search__query">{{ suggestion.query }}</span>
      </template>
    </PopularSearch>
    <button>Custom Behaviour</button>
  </template>
</PopularSearches>
```
