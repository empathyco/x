# X Components

X Components is a library based on components, it offers you the possibility to combine these components
in different ways to create your own search experience. These components can be used even if
you don't want to build a search experience, they can be used to build a regular application
but taking advantage of the flexibility of these components.

A documentation about how to install and use these components can be found here:
