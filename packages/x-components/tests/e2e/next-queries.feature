    And   start button is clicked
    Then  empathize should be visible
    When  a "<query>" with results is typed
    Then  number of rows requested in "<request>" is <maxItemsToRequest>

    Then  the searched query is displayed in the search-box
    And   next queries do not contain the searched query
    Examples:
      | hideSessionQueries | maxItemsToRequest | loadOnInit | query     | nextQueryItem | request |
      | true               | 5                 | true       | playmobil | 0             | interceptedNextQueries |

  Scenario Outline: 2. Next query is not shown if it matches a session history query
    Given following config: hide session queries <hideSessionQueries>, requested items <maxItemsToRequest>, loadOnInit <loadOnInit>
    And   start button is clicked
    Then  empathize should be visible

    When  clear history queries button is clicked
    Then  next queries contain the history query

    Examples:
      | hideSessionQueries | maxItemsToRequest | loadOnInit | query     | nextQueryItem | request                |
      | true               | 5                 | true       | playmobil | 0             | interceptedNextQueries |
      | false              | 5                 | true       | playmobil | 0             | interceptedNextQueries |
