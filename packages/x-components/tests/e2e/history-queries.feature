Feature: History queries component

  Background:
    Given a results API with a known response
    And   a next queries API
    And   a query suggestions API
    And   a popular searches API
    And   a related tags API
    And   a tracking API

  Scenario Outline:  1. History query is clicked and deleted
    Given following config: hide if equals query <hideIfEqualsQuery>, debounce <debounceInMs>, requested items <maxItemsToStore>, rendered <maxItemsToRender>, instant search <instant>
    And   start button is clicked
    And   a "<list>" of queries already searched
    When  search-input is focused
    And   history query number <historyQueryItem> is clicked
    And   search-input is focused
    And   related results are displayed
    Then  the searched query is displayed in the search-box
    And   the searched query is not displayed in history queries if <hideIfEqualsQuery> is true
    When  clear search button is pressed
    And   the delete button of <historyQueryItem> is clicked
    Then  the deleted history query is removed from history queries
    And   the number of rendered history queries is <maxItemsToRender> - 1 if <maxItemsToStore> < <maxItemsToRender>

    Examples:
      | hideIfEqualsQuery | debounceInMs | maxItemsToStore | maxItemsToRender | instant | historyQueryItem | list                                                                                                             |
      | true              | 150          | 15              | 5                | true    | 4                | puzzle, funko, puzzle 3d, funko pop, puzzle 3d harry, funko pop iron, puzzle 3d harry potter, funko pop iron man |
      | false             | 150          | 5               | 8                | true    | 4                | puzzle, funko, puzzle 3d, funko pop, puzzle 3d harry, funko pop iron, puzzle 3d harry potter, funko pop iron man |

  Scenario Outline: 2. Clear history queries button is clicked
    Given following config: hide if equals query <hideIfEqualsQuery>, debounce <debounceInMs>, requested items <maxItemsToStore>, rendered <maxItemsToRender>, instant search <instant>
    And   start button is clicked
    And   a "<list>" of queries already searched
    When  search-input is focused
    And   clear history queries button is clicked
    Then  no history queries are displayed
    And   clear history queries button is disabled

    Examples:
      | hideIfEqualsQuery | debounceInMs | maxItemsToStore | maxItemsToRender | instant | list                     |
      | true              | 150          | 15              | 5                | true    | puzzle, funko, puzzle 3d |

  Scenario Outline: 3. Query containing a history query is typed
    Given following config: hide if equals query <hideIfEqualsQuery>, debounce <debounceInMs>, requested items <maxItemsToStore>, rendered <maxItemsToRender>, instant search <instant>
    And   start button is clicked
    And   no history queries are displayed
    When  "<query>" is searched
    And   "<followingQuery>" is searched
    Then  the searched query is displayed in the search-box
    When  clear search button is pressed
    Then  "<query>" is deleted from history queries, whereas "<followingQuery>" remains

    Examples:
      | hideIfEqualsQuery | debounceInMs | maxItemsToStore | maxItemsToRender | instant | query | followingQuery |
      | true              | 150          | 15              | 5                | true    | le    | go             |
      | true              | 150          | 15              | 5                | true    | le    | go star wars   |

  Scenario Outline: 4. History query is not stored if instant search is false
    Given a results API with a known response
    Given following config: hide if equals query <hideIfEqualsQuery>, debounce <debounceInMs>, requested items <maxItemsToStore>, rendered <maxItemsToRender>, instant search <instant>
    And   start button is clicked
    When  a "<query>" with results is typed
    Then  no history queries are displayed after <debounceInMs> ms if <instant> is false

    Examples:
      | hideIfEqualsQuery | debounceInMs | maxItemsToStore | maxItemsToRender | instant | query  |
      | true              | 1000         | 15              | 5                | true    | barbie |
      | true              | 1000         | 15              | 5                | false   | barbie |

  Scenario Outline: 5. Number and order of rendered history queries
    Given following config: hide if equals query <hideIfEqualsQuery>, debounce <debounceInMs>, requested items <maxItemsToStore>, rendered <maxItemsToRender>, instant search <instant>
    And   start button is clicked
    And   a "<list>" of queries already searched
    When  search-input is focused
    And   history query number <historyQueryItem> is clicked
    Then  related results are displayed
    When  clear search button is pressed
    Then  the searched query is removed from <historyQueryItem> position in history queries
    And   the searched query is the first item in history queries
    And   displayed history queries are min of number of queries already searched, max requested items <maxItemsToStore>, max rendered items <maxItemsToRender>

    Examples:
      | hideIfEqualsQuery | debounceInMs | maxItemsToStore | maxItemsToRender | instant | historyQueryItem | list                                                      |
      | false             | 150          | 4               | 6                | true    | 1                | puzzle, funko, lego, coche, barbie, casa, mu√±eca, peluche |

  Scenario Outline: 6. Rendered history queries list is empty if no results are provided
    Given following config: hide if equals query <hideIfEqualsQuery>, debounce <debounceInMs>, requested items <maxItemsToStore>, rendered <maxItemsToRender>, instant search <instant>
    And   a results API with no results
    And   start button is clicked
    And   no history queries are displayed
    When  "<query>" is searched
    Then  no results message is displayed
    When  clear search button is pressed
    Then  no history queries are displayed
    And   clear history queries button is enabled

    Examples:
      | hideIfEqualsQuery | debounceInMs | maxItemsToStore | maxItemsToRender | instant | query  |
      | false             | 150          | 15              | 5                | true    | puzzle |
