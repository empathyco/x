    And semantic queries results are displayed

    Examples:

    And a results API with <resultsNumber> results
    When start button is clicked
    And "<query>" is searched
    Then related results are displayed
    And semantic queries request is not fired after <msToWaitForRequest> ms
    And semantic queries are not displayed
