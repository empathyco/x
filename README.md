## Development configuration

This mono-repo is handled by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) using `npm`. Follow the next steps to prepare your
development environment.

1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/empathyco/x.git`.
2. From the root folder, install the dependencies: `npm install`. This will link all the project between themselves.
3. Run a build so linked projects work: `npm run build`.
