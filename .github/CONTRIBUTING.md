## How to contribute

### Report Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

You can create an issue by filling in the
[Bug Report template](https://github.com/empathyco/x/issues/new/choose). Before creating a new bug
issue, do a quick check to make sure the issue hasn’t been discussed or created before in the
project.

> **Note:** If you find a **closed** issue that seems to describe the same situation as that you're
> experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body.

### Suggest new features or enhancements

We’d love to hear your suggestions for enhancements for Interface X, whether they are completely new
features or minor improvements to existing functionality.

To suggest any new feature, file a new issue using the
[Feature Request template](https://github.com/empathyco/x/issues/new/choose).

### Contribute code for the first time

Unsure where to start with Interface X? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and
`help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/empathyco/x/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues that should
  only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/empathyco/x/labels/help%20wanted) - issues that are
  usually a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by the total number of comments. While not perfect, the number of
comments is a reasonable proxy for determining the impact that a given change will have.

### Set up your development environment

This monorepo is handled by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) using `npm`. To prepare your
development environment, proceed as follows:

1. Fork the X repo and then clone it to your local environment:
   `git clone https://github.com/empathyco/x.git`.
2. Install the dependencies in the root folder: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. This links all the
   projects.
3. Run a build so that the linked projects work: `npm run build`.

### Pull requests

There are a number of steps must follow to have your contribution considered by the repo
maintainers. All pull requests (PRs) must be approved by 2 reviewers to be merged into the project:

1. Keep your PRs small - don’t pack multiple changes into the same PR.
2. Perform a self-review before submitting your PR:
   - Create a draft PR and do a full review yourself — complete with comments, docs, and tasks.
     After finishing a piece of code, it's very tempting to just dump your changes in a PR and let
     other people find the mistakes (particularly if it is a larger change that took a few days).
     Don’t be lazy — be disciplined; your work is not over yet.
   - You can also use this “self-review” to point things out to your reviewers — “I’m not sure about
     this name? Can you think of a better one?”, “Should this really be nullable? What do you
     think?” — Often by writing such questions, you actually find you can answer them yourself and
     self-reflection becomes part of your everyday coding thought process. In other words,
     internalizing this self-review process makes you a better developer.
3. Follow all instructions given in [the PR template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
4. Follow the [style guides](#style-guides).
5. After you submit your PR, verify that all
   [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing.
6. Acknowledge and respond to each and every comment.
